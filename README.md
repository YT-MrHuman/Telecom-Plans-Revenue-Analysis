# Telecom Plans R# Telecom Plan Revenue Analysis: Ultimate vs. Surf ðŸ“žðŸ“Š

This analysis models Megaline's Surf/Ultimate plan revenue using 500 users.  Steps include: Data cleaning/merging (5 sets), usage calculation (applying Megaline's specific rounding rules for calls/data), revenue modeling (including overages), and t-tests to compare average revenue between Ultimate/Surf and NY-NJ/other regions. 

## What the Project Does

This analysis uses a small client selection (500 users) to model monthly usage (calls, texts, and data) and financial outcomes for Megaline's two prepaid plans. The project executes the following steps:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Merge five separate datasets (`calls`, `internet`, `messages`, `plans`, and `users`)and perform essential cleaning, type conversion, and error handling.
2.  **Usage Calculation:** Process raw usage data, applying Megaline's specific rounding rules (**seconds to minutes per call; total MB to GB per month**), to calculate the number of calls, minutes used, texts sent, and data volume per user, per month.
3.  **Revenue Modeling:** Develop a robust function to calculate the **exact monthly revenue** generated by each user, accounting for the prepaid package limits and the specific overage fees for each plan.
4.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Calculate and visualize the central tendency (mean) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation) for minutes, texts, and data volume for both the Surf and Ultimate plans using histograms to describe the distributions.
5.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Conduct two statistical hypothesis tests using the appropriate criteria (t-test) to validate key business questions:
      * Test 1: Is there a significant difference in the average monthly revenue between **Ultimate** and **Surf** plan users?
      * Test 2: Is the average monthly revenue from users in the **NY-NJ area** different from the revenue generated by users from other regions?

## Why the Project Is Useful

This project provides Megaline's commercial department with direct, data-driven answers to their most critical strategic question:

  * **Optimal Advertising Budget Allocation:** The final conclusion explicitly determines which plan, **Surf** or **Ultimate**, is the more profitable for the company, allowing the commercial team to immediately shift advertising focus and budget to maximize revenue.
  * **Predictive Cost/Usage Modeling:** By analyzing the mean, variance, and distribution of usage for each plan, the company gains a detailed understanding of the **typical user profile** and the frequency of overage charges, aiding in future plan design and risk assessment.
  * **Strategic Market Segmentation:** The regional hypothesis test specifically assesses the performance of a high-value metropolitan area (NY-NJ) versus the rest of the customer base, informing decisions on whether to target the region with specialized advertising or pricing models.
  * **Methodological Rigor:** The use of statistical hypothesis testing ensures that business conclusions are based on statistically significant differences, preventing the company from making costly decisions based on random sample variation.

## How Users Can Get Started with the Project

To set up and run this analysis, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook/Lab and several common data science libraries.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x**
2.  **Jupyter Notebook** (or JupyterLab)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd telecom-revenue-analysis

# Install dependencies (pandas and scipy for statistical tests are key)
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Data Acquisition

This project uses five separate CSV files. The raw data should be acquired and placed in a `datasets/` folder within the project root.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `megaline_calls.csv` | Individual call data. |
| `megaline_internet.csv` | Individual internet session data. |
| `megaline_messages.csv` | Individual text message data. |
| `megaline_plans.csv` | Detailed plan tariffs and limits. |
| `megaline_users.csv` | User demographic and plan information. |

### Running the Notebook

1.  Ensure all data files are in place.

2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open the file **`Sprint 3 Final Project cleaned up notebook.ipynb`** (or similarly named primary notebook file).

4.  Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the data cleaning, calculations, analysis, and hypothesis tests.
